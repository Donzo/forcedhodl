Hackathon project for ETHChicago 2023 - Timelocked ETH Wallets

[Forced Hodl]([https://pages.github.com/](https://forcedhodl.com/)) is a hybrid Web3 application designed to teach users the value of saving and delayed gratification. Users generate an Ethereum address and lock it for a set amount of time. They then receive a keystore as a paper wallet or JSON file. They also receive a public key. The wallet can be filled with ETH, yield bearing tokens, or NFTs. But the user cannot decrypt the wallet until the time set at wallet creation has lapsed. When that time has lapsed, the user can return to the site, present their access code (created at the time of wallet generation) and their public key. Then, the user will receive the decryption code. This code can then unlock the keystore file, which has been stored by the user and NOT the server, and the Ethereum wallet can be imported and used like any other hotwallet.
